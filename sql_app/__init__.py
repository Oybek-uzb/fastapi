# __init__.py is just an empty file, but it tells Python that sql_app with all its modules (Python files) is a package.
# SQLAlchemy is the Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper
# In these examples we will use SQLite, but it is not difficult adapt to any others databases supported by SQLAlchemy
# They are: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, etc.
# An ORM has tools to convert ("map") between objects in code and database tables ("relations")
# With an ORM, you normally create a class that represents a table in a SQL database,
# each attribute of the class represents a column, with a name and type.
# These ORMs also have tools to make the connections or relations between tables or entities.
